Cherry allows you to detect user inputs to create interactive components or elements in your application.

### Get input key

You can simply check if a key is pressed.

```cpp
if(CherryApp.IsKeyPressed(Cherry::CherryKey::A))
{
    // Key pressed !
}
```

Soon, we will be able to detect double or triple clicks, key holds, and even mouse input!
