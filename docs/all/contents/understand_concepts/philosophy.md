> Cherry aims to be a simple yet complete framework for building software and applications.

It provides a straightforward development environment using modern, native C++, allowing developers to build high-level applications easily, without having to deal with low-level details like pointers or other advanced C++ concepts. Cherry also supports interpreted programming in other languages, offering flexibility across different development styles.

With Cherry, users can develop in a simplified way while still benefiting from powerful features.

Cherry also includes a rich set of built-in tools useful for app development, such as sound management, translation support, asset handling, theming, and visual effects.

The goal of Cherry is to make it easy to create beautiful, modern user interfaces with great UI/UX capabilities, without having to rely on web technologies to build native applications.
