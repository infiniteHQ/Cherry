## History
Cherry was originally created for [Vortex](https://vortex.infinite.si/), our platform dedicated to hacking, creation, DIY project and giving healthy and ethical tools for creators.

Everything from one need : having a reactive, advanced, and efficient interface. To accomplish this, we spend a lot of time trying many technologies and liked a lot the [Immediate Mode GUI concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_(computer_graphics)#Immediate_mode_GUI), implemented by the amazing [Dear ImGui library, from ocornut](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).

Immediate mode is really great but can be tricky and not fully adapted with ui components, retained/static renders, using and manipulate object components and basically when we want to create a complete application.

The ideal would be to take the best of immediate mode and classic static retained renders, like classical applications. Well, Cherry was created for that !

Now, Cherry is a big project helping people to create advanced like simple modern interfaces, used by numerous projects of many natures like games, debuggers, editors and more !
