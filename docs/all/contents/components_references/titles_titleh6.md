### Examples 
#### Create title (as object)
```cpp
CherryKit::TitleSix(CherryID("custom_id"), "Very Small Title");
```
> `TitleSix` with a `CherryID` will create an object that you can interact with across different points or frames of your application.

---

#### Create a immediate mode title
```cpp
CherryKit::TitleSix(CherryInline, "Very Small Title");
```
> `TitleSix` with a `CherryID` set to `CherryInline` will create a non-static component (not a object). The component will operate in immediate mode, meaning it will be updated every frame.

---
#### Create a anonymous mode title
```cpp
CherryKit::TitleSix("Very Small Title");
```
> `TitleSix` will create an anonymous object. This object will behave like any other object but without an identifier, making it a mix between object mode and immediate mode. It is optimized for performance while retaining the advantages and flexibility of a regular object.
